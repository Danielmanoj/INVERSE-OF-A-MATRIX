# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step1 :

import numpy as np.

Step 2:

Get the input as array.

Step 3:

Assume b=np.linalg.inv(a).

Step 4:

print the value of b. 

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: MANOJ G
#RegisterNumber: 212222240060

import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
result = np.linalg.inv(A)
print(result)
```
## Output:
